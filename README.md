# Code-Quiz

Challenge-4

***

This weeks assignment was to create a quiz relating to javascript or other web-devloping related topics. The acceptance criteria for this assignment goes as follows:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

WHEN I click the start button

THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question

THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly

THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over

THEN I can save my initials and my score

***

One of the first things to be presented to the user is the start button that allows the questions to render

After a question is answered the user will receive feedback saying "Correct!" or "Oh no! You lost 10 seconds!"

When the timer reaches zero or when the quiz is over, the function for rendering questions ends

After the quiz is over, the user will receive their score/80 and a percentage of 100

The user will be able to save their score alongside their initials in the local storage with the "Save Score" button

Finally, the user have a "New Game" button available that will restart the page and allow the questions to render again.
